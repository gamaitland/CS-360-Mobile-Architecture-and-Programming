* # Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app was designed to be a simple inventory tracker for a warehouse. Users of this app would include warehouse employees, from inventory specialists to warehouse managers. The client requested a database to store user information and inventory items, a login and registration component, and inventory items displayed in a grid with add and delete properties.

* # What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
Due to the requirements from the client, there was a necessity to include a screen for logging in that could also double as registration, a screen to view the inventory grid with add and delete functions, and a screen to see the details of each item. With each item, there is a screen that shows the details of the object, inclusive of description and quantity. From this screen, the user can increase or decrease objects. This design is successful because it keeps the user’s experience in mind. Initially, I thought to have multiple screens each complete a different task, but I discovered that it would be too convoluted for the client if they were using it in a face paced environment like a warehouse. In that case, I sought to make it as simple as possible but effective enough for their requirements.

* # How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached coding my app by using a combination of things I’ve learned from the readings, the zyBooks material, and using examples from previously created work with properly cited sources. Because I struggled with some of the finer details of wiring an app together in Android SDK, I found that this technique gave me a clear pathway. The zyBooks material gave me a strong foundation to start off with. It was up to me to fill in the blanks of the remaining requirements in terms of what was missing and how to implement it. Then I used resources from videos or GitHub repositories to use as an example of different ways it could be completed. Feedback from my instructor also gave me clear insight as to whether or not I was on the right path.

* # How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested my code by constantly running my project in the emulator whenever I made changes. This would include something as simple as changing a label to see how it would look, to adding and deleting parts of my code to see if it would break the app. This process is important because it revealed which parts of my code were redundant, easy to break, or hard-coded rather than modular.

* # Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to overcome a challenge during weeks 5-6, where I found myself falling behind in understanding of the material. During this time, I had to ask for additional help in order to complete the assignments to the best of my ability. It also required me to spend additional time on resources outside of what was recommended each week, such as Youtube, Stack Overflow, etc. Though I still found myself struggling to connect things together, I found that it alleviated some of the stress since I understood more than I did before.

* # In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge of knowing my resources in terms of what materials would help me when creating my app.
